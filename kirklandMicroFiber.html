                                Microfiber towels are woven from a premium blend of polyester and polyamide. During the manufacturing process, the microfiber is split, producing a multi-stranded fiber with a finer diameter than a human hair. These tiny strands not only lift and trap debris but they are super absorbent! They will absorb seven times their own weight in water.<br>Perfect for Auto Detailing. Leave your car, RV, motorcycle, aircraft, or boat with a showroom shine after every wash.<br>They Work Like Magic! Microfiber is the technology of today, leaving behind a lint-free, scratch-free, and streak-free finish. </p>
