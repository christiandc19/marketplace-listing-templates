                                The 279T provides high performance, moving air up to 80 ft., focusing a powerful beam of air horizontally across the room with the tilt feature to adjust that airflow vertically towards the ceiling and all points in between. Horizontal airflow is ideal for traditional whole room circulation, particularly for warm weather use. Focusing the air upwards maximizes the 279T’s ability to force the warm air off the ceiling to the rest of the room – an added bonus during the winter months. The minimalistic design and size allow the 279T to easily fit into your living space. A three speed soft touch control panel is located conveniently atop the unit within easy reach with a handy cord wrap located on the back of the unit.
