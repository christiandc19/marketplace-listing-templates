                                <br>* If you have attempted pairing multiple times and are still failing, follow the instructions below:

To determine which device is not communicating correctly you can use a device that can scan for Bluetooth devices, like a cell phone. Set the device to scan for Bluetooth devices. If the TV's Bluetooth is working your device will discover it. It will not be able to connect to it because the TV only will connect to the 3D glasses and the QWERTY remote but you will be able to see if the TV's Bluetooth is working.
                                <br>* If the TV's Bluetooth appears then the QWERTY remote will need service.
                                <br>* If the TV's Bluetooth signal does not appear the TV will require service.
