                                From our first store in Seattle's Pike Place Market to our coffee houses around the world, customers requested a freshly brewed coffee they could enjoy thorough the day. So in 2008 our master blenders and roasters created it for you, a blend so consistent and harmonious that no single characteristic dominated - or disappears. A smooth well-rounded blend of Latin American coffees with subtly rich flavors of chocolate and toasted nuts, it;a served fresh everyday at a Starbucks store near you.</p>
